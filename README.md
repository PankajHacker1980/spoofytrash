Introduction
Urban waste management is a pressing challenge in many cities. SpoofyTrash addresses this issue by providing an automated solution to detect and report garbage accumulation. Utilizing the YOLOv4 model for object detection, the application processes video feeds to identify waste items, logs complaints to a Firestore database, and sends SMS alerts via Twilio to relevant authorities for prompt action.

Features
Real-time Garbage Detection: Processes live video feeds to identify and locate garbage using the YOLOv4 model.

Automated Reporting: Logs detected garbage incidents with location and timestamp to a Firestore database.

SMS Notifications: Sends immediate alerts to designated personnel through Twilio integration.

Comprehensive Logging: Maintains records of all detected incidents for analysis and reporting.



Usage
Run the application:


python spoofytrash.py.py
Monitor the output: The application will display the video feed with detected garbage highlighted. Detected incidents will be logged to the Firestore database, and SMS alerts will be sent to the configured phone numbers.
